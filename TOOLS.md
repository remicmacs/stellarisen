# Development tools

GIT FOR THE WIN (Wtf is a rebase anyway ??)

Vagrant is great, PuPHPet also. Allowed us to use a flexible Vagrant box without learning Puppet. But we had a problem.

Deployment scripts. Deploy and forget. Code right away with the same environment among all devs. But a lot of dev time was spend on writing these scripts that brings almost no value to the final product. It is interesting for us to have something we can share easily but we had trouble with PuPHPet and who knows it will be working as we intended it. It is also a plus to have something we can share easily with our teachers.

Dropped Babel and Webpack.
