## No unit testing (COME ON!!)

Once again we did not unit test our code. Once again we were eager to write clean code and to make it resistant to regressions, by using unit testings. We both are aware of the advantages of unit testing, and we would both like to know how. However, we were not yet introduced to unit testing, either at school or at work, and it seems that unit testing is not something you just know how to do by reading the readme.

Working in PHP **and** Javascript on this project we would have had a hard time learning multiple tools for unit testing. And we lacked guidance on questions such as :

* How do I unit test fetch asynchronous requests ?
* How do I unit test wrong state situations ?
* How do I unit test database-dependant units ?
* ...

Of course we could have looked for mentoring and guidance online or with our teachers but we were already in over our head with the rest of the work.

But deep down we know that test oriented development is the right way, and most likely not at all a waste of time. So how did we learn programming if we came to think of unit testing as something we could do "if we have time" ?
Better yet a question : we both are programmers used to competitive programming exercices. We are accustomed to test our program against test input and output data. TDD should be something already familiar to us. So why don't we think about doing it until the last minute (or ever) ?
